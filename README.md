## Schools section of N1
- Nursery: age under 5. Primary: ages 3/4 to 10. Middle: ages 3/4 to 16/18. Secondary: ages 11 to 16/18.
- Special schools: both day and boarding, provide education for children with Special Educational Needs, who cannot be educated satisfactorily in mainstream schools.
- Maintained: Schools maintained by the local authorities.

## Pupils section of N1
- Schools’ data are derived from the Pupil Level Annual School Census returns and STATS 1 returns supplied by schools open on Census day in January each year. (Blank = new school.)

## Governance section of N1
- 'Community': Schools which are wholly owned and maintained by the local authority. The local authority is the admissions authority — it has main responsibility for deciding arrangements for admitting pupils.
- 'Voluntary aided': These are established by voluntary bodies, mainly the religious denominations, but are maintained by the LAs. The admission authority of a voluntary aided school is the governing body.
- 'Voluntary controlled': These are established by voluntary bodies, mainly the religious denominations, but are maintained by the LAs. The admission authority of a voluntary controlled school is the LA.
- 'Foundation': Foundation schools have more freedom than community schools to manage their school and decide on their own admissions. Funding comes from the local authority.
- 'Not Applicable': NA

## Welsh medium type
- 'Welsh medium': Welsh is the day to day language of the school. Welsh is used as the language of communication with the pupils and for the school’s administration. The school communicates with parents in both languages.
- 'Dual Stream' (under primary school only in N1): Both Welsh and English are used in the day to day business of the school. The language of communication with the pupils is determined by the nature of the curricular provision, but in some schools high priority is given to creating a Welsh-language ethos throughout the school. The school communicates with parents in both languages.
- 'Transitional' (under primary school only in N1): Welsh is the language of the day to day business of the school. A high priority is given to creating a Welsh ethos. The school communicates with parents in both languages.
- 'English with significant Welsh': The day to day language or languages of the school are determined by the school’s linguistic context. Both languages are used as languages of communication with the pupils and for the school’s administration. A high priority is given to creating a Welsh ethos. The school communicates with parents in both languages.
- 'English medium': English is the language of the day to day business of the school, but some Welsh is also used as a language of communication with the pupils with the aim of improving their capacity to use everyday Welsh. The school communicates with parents either in English or in both languages.
- 'Bilingual (Category A)': At least 80% of subjects apart from English and Welsh are taught only through the medium of Welsh to all pupils. One or two subjects are taught to some pupils in English or in both languages.
- 'Bilingual (Category B)': At least 80% of subjects (excluding Welsh and English) are taught through the medium of Welsh but are also taught through the medium of English.
